## My process

I made it mobile-first as suggested. I had done a few small projects like this before. It was a good practice

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I am not very familiar with media queries, but I am trying to learn. I have gained a bit more understanding in this project. What I did not fully understand in the project was the difference between the width shown in Figma and the width I see on the screen. Nevertheless, I achieved a fairly close result. I set a specific height, but I am not very happy with it.
